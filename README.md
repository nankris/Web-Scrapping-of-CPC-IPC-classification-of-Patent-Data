# Web-Scrapping-of-CPC-IPC-classification-of-Patent-Data
In this code i tried to extract CPC/IPC classification from patents.google.com. I will update the latest version as soon as possible
Latest update #18 january
completed webscrapping of all the classifications present in google patents website for a particular patent. You just have to paste link n
of the patent you want to scrape and you will get desired output of classifications seperated by ">>". If you require any other separato, you can
change it in the code it self. comments are writted according to the code.
